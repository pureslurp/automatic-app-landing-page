# Privacy Policy
Protecting users privacy is paramount to the Plums, and we strive to use as little data as possible from each user.
- We do not collect any personal information from our users besides what is manually submitted by the user while using the application. 
- The Plum App does not share data with any third party.
- The Plum App retension policy is that we keep the users data until the user goes dormant for 90 days, at which point the all users data will be dissolved but they will maintain their login credentials for 180 days.
- The Plum App will ask permission if it uses any internal data, such as images from your camera role. (The Plum App will only request access to data that is critical to the core functionality of the Application)
- The Plum App does not have access to your password and it is stored securely within a Firestore authentication database
